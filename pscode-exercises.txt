// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1 = Input Number
remainder = num1 % 2
if remainder is equal to 0 print "The Number is Even"
else
print "The Number is Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

num1 = Input Number
num2 = Input Number
num3 = Input Number
num4 = Input Number
num5 = Input Number
sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
average = sum / 5

if num1 is greater than num2 then num1 equals max
else 
num2 equals max
if num3 is greater than max then num3 equals max
else 
max remains the same
if num4 is greater than max then num4 equals max
else 
max remains the same
if num5 is greater than max then num5 equals max
else 
max remains the same

if num1 is less than num2 then num1 equals min
else 
num2 equals min
if num3 is less than min then num3 equals min
else 
min remains the same
if num4 is less than min then num4 equals min
else 
min remains the same
if num5 is greater than max then num5 equals min
else 
min remains the same

print "The Average is"
print average

print "The Max is"
print max

print "The Min is"
print min
